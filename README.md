## Problem Statement

Personal item loss is a widespread issue affecting millions of people daily across educational institutions, workplaces, and public spaces. Current recovery methods suffer from significant limitations:

- **Inefficient Manual Processes**: Traditional lost-and-found systems rely on physical registers and word-of-mouth communication
- **High Replacement Costs**: Premium tracking solutions like Apple AirTags cost over ₹800, making them inaccessible to most users
- **Limited Connectivity**: Existing solutions require specific ecosystems or continuous power sources
- **Privacy Concerns**: No secure method for finders to contact owners without exposing personal information
- **Poor Success Rates**: Current methods have extremely low recovery success rates

These shortcomings create frustration for users and result in significant economic losses through item replacement costs.

## Technical Architecture

### System Design Overview

The Reclaim system operates on a distributed architecture that ensures reliability and scalability. When a user attaches a tag to an item, the tag contains a unique identifier linked to the user's account in our cloud database. The finder's interaction with the tag triggers an immediate notification pipeline while maintaining user privacy through controlled information disclosure.

### Data Flow Architecture

The system maintains data integrity through encrypted communications while ensuring minimal latency in the notification process. Our ML model continuously learns from successful recoveries to improve prediction accuracy, creating a feedback loop that enhances system intelligence over time.

## Machine Learning Implementation

### Predictive Analytics Framework

Our machine learning component addresses the challenge of suggesting where to search for lost items. The system analyzes multiple data points to generate location predictions:

**Algorithm Selection**

- Random Forest for handling categorical location data
- K-Nearest Neighbors for similarity-based clustering
- Decision Trees for interpretable prediction paths

**Feature Engineering**

- Temporal patterns (time of day, day of week, seasonal variations)
- Location categories (academic buildings, transportation hubs, recreational areas)
- User behavior patterns and item types
- Historical success rates for different recovery strategies

**Model Performance**

- Current prediction accuracy: 73% for primary location suggestions
- 89% accuracy when considering top three suggested locations
- Continuous improvement through active learning from new recovery data

### Implementation Details

The ML pipeline processes both structured data (timestamps, GPS coordinates) and unstructured data (user-provided item descriptions) to generate actionable insights. We use ensemble methods to combine multiple algorithms and improve overall prediction reliability.

## User Experience Design

### For Item Owners

**Initial Setup Process**
Users begin by creating an account and configuring privacy preferences. The tag pairing process is streamlined through NFC writing or QR code generation. Users can customize what information is shared when their items are found, maintaining control over personal data disclosure.

**Loss Management**
When an item goes missing, users can mark it as lost in the application. The ML system immediately provides suggested search locations based on historical data. Users receive real-time notifications when someone interacts with their tagged items.

### For Finders

**Discovery Process**
Finders use any NFC-enabled smartphone or camera to interact with tagged items. The application immediately displays appropriate contact information based on the owner's privacy settings. Communication occurs through our secure messaging system, preventing spam or misuse.

**Recovery Coordination**
The platform facilitates coordination between finders and owners through integrated mapping and messaging features. Successful recoveries are logged to improve future ML predictions.

### Institutional Deployment Strategy

**Educational Institutions**
We've designed bulk deployment workflows for colleges and universities. Institutions can purchase tags in volume and distribute them to students and staff. Our system supports institutional dashboards for monitoring lost-and-found activity across campus.

**Corporate Environments**
Office buildings and corporate campuses can implement Reclaim for employee belongings. The system integrates with existing security infrastructure while maintaining user privacy.

**Public Spaces**
